We have two dataset.
  1) One displays the match details, match between, where did the match take place, who won the toss, who won the match, etc.
  2) Second DataSet displays every ball of match. Example in the first match how did the team lose wickets, number of 2's, 4,s and 6's.
Using first Dataset we can find out where did most of the match happen, who won the maximum number of matches across all season of IPL, who became player of the match the most.
Using Second DataSet you can find out how many sixes were made by a team in a match using "ID column", how many catches were taken in a match, etc.
